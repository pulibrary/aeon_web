                    Princeton University Library welcomes all researchers to its Special Collections reading rooms in the Harvey S. Firestone Library, Seeley G. Mudd Manuscript Library, and Marquand Library of Art and Archaeology. To submit a request to view materials, we ask that researchers not currently affiliated with Princeton University (i.e. current student, staff, or faculty member) register for a Special Collections Research Account and agree to the following user guidelines.
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Independent researchers using Special Collections materials are required to obtain a Special Collections ID Card (SCID) in the <a href="https://libcal.princeton.edu/hours">Access Office</a> located in the main lobby of <a href="https://m.princeton.edu/map/campus?bldid=0069">Firestone Library</a>. There is no charge for the card, but it is a requirement for access to our reading rooms. The Access Office will request to see a valid photo ID, enter you into our collection management system, take your photograph, and then print your SCID card on-site for your use (the process should take no longer than 10 minutes).</li>
                  </ul>
                  <h2>Accessing the Collections</h2>
                  <p>We ask that researchers read the following guidelines prior to using the collections. These guidelines are intended to ensure the safety and longevity of collection materials for future use.</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Complete this user registration form,</li>
                    <li>Obtain an SCID card (please see "First Time User Registration" section above for more information),</li>
                    <li>Follow care and handling guidelines (please see the "Care & Handling" section below for more information),</li>
                    <li><strong>Researchers may come across sensitive information in collections and agree to alert staff about the existence of these types of documents. They include, but are not limited to confidential, FERPA, HIPAA, or potentially classified government materials. Researchers are encouraged to speak to staff in person or utilize the <a href="https://library.princeton.edu/special-collections/ask-us">Ask Us! form</a> to convey this information.</strong></li>
                  </ul>
                  <h2>Care & Handling</h2>
                  <p>We ask that researchers abide by the <a href="https://library.princeton.edu/special-collections/policies/reading-room-guidelines">care and handling guidelines found on our website</a>, intended to ensure the safety and longevity of collection materials for future use. Researchers are more than welcome to request further clarification or guidance from staff on any of the guidelines.</p>
                  <h2>Digitization</h2>
                  <p>Digitization guidelines can be found in detail on our website (<a href="https://library.princeton.edu/special-collections/services/digitization-publication-services">Special Collections: Firestone & Mudd</a>; <a href="https://library.princeton.edu/marquand/services/photodup">Marquand Library</a>). Researchers are more than welcome to request further clarification or guidance from staff on any of the guidelines.</p>
                  <h2>Publication</h2>
                  <h3>Notice: Warning Concerning Copyright Restrictions</h3>
                  <p>The copyright law of the United States (<a href="https://www.copyright.gov/title17/title17.pdf">Title 17, &sect;108, United States Code</a>) governs the making of photocopies or other reproductions of copyrighted material. Under certain conditions specified in the law, libraries and archives are authorized to furnish a photocopy or other reproduction. One of these specified conditions is that the photocopy or other reproduction is not to be "used for any purpose other than private study, scholarship or research." If a user makes a request for, or later uses, a photocopy or other reproduction for purposes in excess of "fair use," that user may be liable for copyright infringement. This institution reserves the right to refuse the use of a digital camera if, in its judgment, such use would involve a violation of copyright law. Further, the user agrees to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless the Princeton University Library, and the Trustees of Princeton University against all claims, demands, costs and expenses incurred by copyright infringement or any other legal or regulatory cause of action arising from the use of the Library's facilities or materials.</p>
                  <h3>Rights and Permissions</h3>
                  <p>It is not required to obtain advanced permission or pay any fee for the publication or use of images of material in our collections, including those provided by Princeton University Library, via our website, catalog or directly from staff.</p>
                  <p>Do note, however, that while Princeton University Library owns the physical materials in its collections, we generally do not own the copyright to those materials. In addition, certain images or materials may also be protected by trademark, privacy rights, publicity rights, or other interests not owned or controlled by Princeton University. It is your responsibility as the researcher to determine whether any permissions related to copyright, privacy, publicity, or any other rights are necessary for your intended use of the Library's materials, and for obtaining all required permissions, if you have not already done so.</p>
                  <p>Furthermore, not all items are eligible for digitization due to copyright, access restrictions, and conservation considerations. Please consult the "Access and Use" note of a collection's finding aid or contact Special Collections staff using our <a href="https://library.princeton.edu/special-collections/ask-us">Ask Us! form</a> for more information.</p>
                  <p>Detailed information on permissions, copyright & credit policies and practices for the Department of Special Collections can be found on the <a href="https://library.princeton.edu/special-collections/policies/copyright-credit-and-citation-guidelines">Copyright, Credit and Citation page on our website</a>.</p>
                  <h2>Security</h2>
                  <p>Please note, for protection of the materials, security devices such as CCTV, still cameras, and alarms are in use in the Firestone Special Collections reading room. Video records are maintained as long as is necessary.</p>
                  <h2>Data Collection and Use</h2>
                  <p>The Princeton University Library may retain, indefinitely, all data and information regarding researcher use of special collections items, including registration, circulation, duplication and publishing requests, as well as related correspondence. This information may be shared with third parties to address issues of legality, security, the administration of library collections, and other endeavors in support of the mission of Princeton University.</p>
                  <p>I agree to indemnify, hold harmless, and release Princeton University, its trustees, officers, administrators, faculty, staff, and other employees or agents against any and all claims, demands, liabilities, damages, costs, and expenses including attorney's fees, without limitation, incurred through the use of the Princeton University library and its material.</p>
